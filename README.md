first you will have to set a link to set requests to || (set to none by default)

proxy time out is how long (in seconds) a proxy will try to make a connection for before being deemed too slow and discarded || (default 30 seconds)

the website protocal is the string before the link starts (default https)

the threads is how many threads will be used in order to spam requests

while spamming a link, your internet might lag or stop entirely. You can solve this by shutting it down, and trying again with less threads
